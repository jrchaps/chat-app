Here is a simple chat application written using the Socket.IO library. I combined an Express server with MongoDB to save messages that will expire after 24 hours.

Technologies: React, Socket.IO, ExpressJS, MongoDB.

The app is hosted on heroku here: https://socket-io-chat-app-chapman.herokuapp.com/
